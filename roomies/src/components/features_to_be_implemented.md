## Guidance Based on Emotion
If a user reports feeling angry or anxious, provide calming reassurances or prompts to help them approach the discussion more objectively.

## Decision-Making Prompts
Based on the user's emotion, you can guide the user through a series of prompts or questions designed to foster resolution. This could be a simple series of binary (yes/no) questions, or a more complex flow based on both their emotion and the specific boundary they want to discuss.

## Voting System
To create a fair decision-making process, implement a voting system. This could involve creating a new Vote component that takes a proposal as a prop, displays it to all roommates, and allows them to vote. After all votes are in, the decision could be made based on majority rules.

## Anonymous Feedback
For sensitive topics, consider an anonymous feedback option. This allows users to express their thoughts without fear of judgment or retaliation.

## Notification System
Implement a notification system to inform all roommates of new proposals, ongoing votes, or resolved issues.

Remember, this is a high-level idea and the real application will be much more involved. You'd need to incorporate user authentication, database interactions, real-time updates, error handling, and more. But this should provide a good starting point for you to build upon.
