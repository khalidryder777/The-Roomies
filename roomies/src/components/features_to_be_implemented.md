## Guidance Based on Emotion
If a user reports feeling angry or anxious, provide calming reassurances or prompts to help them approach the discussion more objectively.

## Decision-Making Prompts
Based on the user's emotion, you can guide the user through a series of prompts or questions designed to foster resolution. This could be a simple series of binary (yes/no) questions, or a more complex flow based on both their emotion and the specific boundary they want to discuss.

## Voting System
To create a fair decision-making process, implement a voting system. This could involve creating a new Vote component that takes a proposal as a prop, displays it to all roommates, and allows them to vote. After all votes are in, the decision could be made based on majority rules.

## Anonymous Feedback
For sensitive topics, consider an anonymous feedback option. This allows users to express their thoughts without fear of judgment or retaliation.

## Notification System
Implement a notification system to inform all roommates of new proposals, ongoing votes, or resolved issues.

## Let's incorporate the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) framework into our conflict resolution system to create a tailored user experience.

Before we proceed, it's important to remember that it's impossible for a single application to fully capture the nuances of interpersonal conflict. However, we can still create a system that guides users through a conflict resolution process tailored to their conflict style.

Here is a rough sketch of how such a system might work:

### User Onboarding and Initial Assessment
When a user signs up for the Roomies application, they are asked to complete a short survey. This survey includes scenarios that allow the system to estimate their default conflict management style based on the TKI model. The results of this survey are stored and associated with the user's profile.

### Conflict Identification
If a conflict arises, the involved parties can go to the "Conflict Resolution" section of the application. Here they can describe the situation, just like in the multi-step form I described earlier. The system can then categorize the conflict based on keywords or phrases used by the users; this can be enhanced by using NLP techniques.

### Conflict Resolution Guidance
Based on the users' conflict styles and the type of conflict, the system can generate a tailored set of questions and prompts to guide them through the conflict resolution process. For example, if one user tends to avoid conflict and the other is competitive, the system might provide prompts to encourage the avoidant user to express their feelings and the competitive user to practice active listening.

### Proposed Solutions & Compromises
After users have shared their perspectives and feelings, the system can suggest potential solutions based on the conflict type and the users' conflict styles. These solutions could be drawn from a pre-determined database or generated using AI techniques and could be refined over time based on user feedback.

### Follow-Up & Adjustments
Once a solution is chosen and implemented, the system can schedule check-ins to ask how things are going. If the same type of conflict keeps arising, the system might suggest a new conflict management approach or recommend professional mediation resources.

This system combines real-world conflict resolution techniques with AI to create a tailored and dynamic conflict resolution process. It's important to keep refining and expanding the system based on user feedback and new advancements in conflict resolution and AI technology.

As a final note, confidentiality and privacy are extremely important in this system. All conflict details and resolutions should be kept private and secure, and users should have the ability to opt-out or adjust their privacy settings at any time.
